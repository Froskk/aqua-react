## [Aquarium](https://aquarium.now.sh)

The objective is to completely fill the board with either Water or Air tiles.

The board consists of

- **Tanks**: Groups of tiles with thick outlines - Each tank can be filled with _air_, _water_, or a _mix of both_. However, _water_ cannot be found above an _air_ tile within the same tank. Similarly, _air_ cannot remain under a _water_ tile.

- **Clues**: Found on the top and left sides - Within a row or column, the clues denote how many tiles must be _water_.

- **Tools**: At the side of the board are the tools to fill tiles with either air, water, or remove the contents of a tile.
